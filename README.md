### Hi there, my name is Maria (she/her) 🪲🧬

I'm a Biologist with a minor in Bioinformatics and Microbiologist from Colombia currently pursuing a master's degree in Biology at KU Leuven (Belgium). My master's thesis is focused on the ecological and evolutionary genomics of _Pogonus chalceus_.

I also study the metagenomic, metabolomic, and organoleptic profiles of coffee fermentations in Colombia.

I am interested in microbial ecology, eco-evo genomics, sensorial ecology, and insect physiology.
