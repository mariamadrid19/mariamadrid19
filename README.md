### Hi there, my name is Maria 🪲🧬🔬

I'm a Biologist with a minor in Bioinformatics and Microbiologist from Colombia currently pursuing a master's degree in Biology at KU Leuven (Belgium). My research is currently focused on the metagenomic, metabolomic, and organoleptic profiles of newly developed fermentation processes in Colombia ☕️🇨🇴. 

My Biology bachelor thesis looked at the electrophysiological response of *Rhodnius prolixus* to a potential insect repellent. We used electronantennography and a newly developed compound to study the physiological response of the insect's antennae. 

I am interested in microbial ecology, bioinformatics, computational biology, sensorial ecology, and insect physiology. My Master's thesis project will focus on comparing the genomes of short- and long-winged *Pogonus* beetles.
