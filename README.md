### Hi there 👋 my name is Maria

I'm a Biologist and Microbiologist from Colombia currently pursuing a master's degree in Biology at KU Leuven (Belgium). My research is currently focused on the metagenomic, metabolomic, and organoleptic profiles of newly developed fermentation processes in Colombia. 

My Biology bachelor thesis looked at the electrophysiological response of Rhodnius prolixus to a potential insect repellent. We used electronantennography and a newly developed compound to study the physiological response of the insect's antennae. 

I am interested in microbial ecology, computational biology, sensorial ecology, and insect physiology. My Master's thesis project will focus on comparing the genomes of short- and long-winged Pogonus beetles.
