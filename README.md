### Hi there, my name is Maria (she/her) 🪲🧬

I'm a Biologist with a minor in Bioinformatics and Microbiologist from Colombia with master's degree in Biology. I'm currently pursuing a PhD at KU Leuven (Belgium), focusing on the ecological and evolutionary genomics of _Pogonus chalceus_.

I simultaneously study the metagenomic, metabolomic, and organoleptic profiles of coffee fermentations in Colombia.

I am interested in microbial ecology, eco-evolutionary genomics, sensorial ecology, and insect physiology.
