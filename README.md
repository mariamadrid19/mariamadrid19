### Hi there, my name is Maria 🪲🧬🔬

I'm a Biologist with a minor in Bioinformatics and Microbiologist from Colombia currently pursuing a master's degree in Biology at KU Leuven (Belgium). My master's thesis is focused on the genomes of _Pogonus chalceus_.

I am also studying the metagenomic, metabolomic, and organoleptic profiles of newly developed coffee fermentation processes in Colombia.

I am interested in microbial ecology, bioinformatics, computational biology, sensorial ecology, and insect physiology.
